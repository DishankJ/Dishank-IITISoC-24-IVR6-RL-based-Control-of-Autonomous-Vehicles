## Walkthrough
We used Deep Q-Learning to solve the two problems of a Self balancing robot and Ball balancing about an axis on a plane. The self balancing robot folder of the repository contains the simulation urdf which is to be used on a software such as Isaac Sim, or any other, to simulate and make the algorithm work better.

## What we learned:
We learned about the Reinforcement Learning and how we can use it to automate things as the agent learns according to a policy over time. We learned about simulation tools such as Gazebo Sim and Isaac Sim/ Gym which are very popular in the world for simulation purposes.
